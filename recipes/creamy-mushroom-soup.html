            <li>1 & 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li> 
                
            <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme,tied in a bundle with kitchen twine</li>

            <li>4 cups chicken broth,or more to taste</li> 
                
            <li>1 cup water, or more to taste</li> 
                
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>

    </p>
    <h2 class="instr">Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>

            <li>Melt butter in a large soup pot over medium-high heat. Sauté mushrooms and 
                1 pinch salt in the melted butter until mushrooms release their juices, 
                5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, 
                stirring often, until juices evaporate and mushrooms are caramelized, 15 to 25 minutes.
                Set aside a few attractive mushroom slices for garnish later, if desired.</li>
            
            <li> Add onion to the mushrooms; cook until onion is soft and translucent, 
                about 5 minutes.</li>

            <li>Stir flour into the mushroom mixture and cook, 
                stirring often, to remove the raw flour taste, about 2 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add thyme bundle and garlic cloves, then pour in 4 cups chicken broth and 1 cup water. 
                Reduce heat to low and simmer for 1 hour. Remove and discard thyme bundle.</li>


            <li>Purée soup with a blender in batches until smooth and thick.</li>

            <li> Stir in cream. If too thick, add a little chicken broth or water. 
                Season with salt and black pepper.</li>

            <li> Ladle into bowls, and garnish with reserved mushroom slices and thyme leaves.</li>
