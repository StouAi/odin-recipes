This is project to practise basic html concepts.
The project creates a website that contains different recipes
The project contains an index.html file that acts as the main page and has links that lead to other recipes

The recipe pages,each having an html file, contain a picture of the dish,a brief description,
an unorder list of ingredients and finally an ordered list of the steps needed to make the dish.
